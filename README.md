# Chechers-with-Python-Turtle

This repo is the final version of a Python project for my AP Computer Science Princeples class. 

It uses the Python Turtle graphics library and fully implements the functionality of a single-player chechers game.

The user is the red player while the black player is a quazi-AI player. This AI player simply picks a random move out of the possible moves moves there. While this functionality is not optimal, the intention of the project was not to implement an effective AI. It was intended to demonstrate a functional game engine.

This project was finished in the fall of 2020.
